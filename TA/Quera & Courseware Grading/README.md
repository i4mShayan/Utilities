# _Quera_ and _Courseware_ Submissions Refinement Script

This script organizes and cleans up student submission folders by eliminating redundant folders and files and cleaning up and fixing file names (e.g., adding missing student IDs and names to the filename)
for both _**Quera**_ and _**Courseware**_ submissions.

## How to Use

1. **Clone the Repository**
   Clone the repository to your local system:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/i4mShayan/Utilities.git
   ```

2. **Download Submissions**
   - **Quera**: Use the `دانلود ارسال های نهایی بر اساس کاربر` button to download submissions. Extract the contents of the ZIP file and place them in a folder.
   - **Courseware**: Download and place the submissions in a folder.

3. **Move the Script**

   Move `refine_pdfs.py` to the main folder where all the submissions are located.

5. **Run the Script**

   Execute in the terminal:

   ```bash
   python refine_pdfs.py
   ```
   
7. **Enjoy!**

   The script will process the submissions folder, and submission files will be cleaned and organized.
